READ ME FIRST!!!
So, there are 2 folders one is python versions and one is executable versions.
If and only if you have python installed, you can run the python versions. If you don't know you have python just check in your apps in your settings.
If you do not have python installed and don't plan to install it just for a single file, run the executable folder versions.

The 3rd folder is only for me to save the code and add any new improvements if python updates or the code dosen't function properly. Don't run any files within that folder.

There are 2 versions of the system crasher.
1) Console Crasher
-> console_systemcrasher.py / .exe
-> The Console crasher launches the barebones crasher in the console which looks kinda ugly and boring ngl.

2) Gui Crasher
Name -> gui_systemcrasher.py / .exe
-> The Gui Crasher uses a password to make sure you are going to use it cuz its quite dangerous and looks overall better

Files to ignore
-> Ignore everything else other than "gui_systemcrasher.py" / .exe and "console_systemcrasher.py" / .exe

What do these files do?
1) highendsystemcrashfixer.py/ .exe
-> This file launches various instances of the system crasher but they all skip the countdown or the gui and go straight for the crashing part. This is used for crashing High-End Systems as in the name of the file.

-> The instances are "1.py" "2.py" "3.py" "4.py" / .exe

-> It also launches them in a "while True:" loop so even if your pc works now, it won't respond sooner or later.

2) icon.png
-> It is the icon in the top left of the gui_systemcrasher.py window. / .exe
Kind of useless but cool I guess?
