Stuff in this repository:-
=============================================================================================
1. Calculators
2. System destroyers (ONLY USE IF YOU HAVE A VM)
-> System Crashers do not destroy (delete or move) any files in your pc. It will only lag it out until its no longer useable (until its on) and you have to hold the power button to force shutdown your computer. It will work perfectly fine and it won't restart if your pc restarts too.
More Coming Soon!
